                    To die for my country, surrounded by the sweaty men it rounded up into its service, was not a lifelong goal of mine. To be fair, I didn’t have a lifelong goal. A younger version of myself had been set on teaching preschool, or kindergarten—didn’t matter really. I just loved kids. That dream was doused by the gaggle of overprotective mothers who had me detained at a playground.

He takes a handful of dried ironwort stalks down from the cupboard, the flower buds crinkling as he counts out six and returns the rest to the bundle.

                    The floorboards creak with soft footsteps in the next room over.
                    
                    He fills a pot one-third of the way with water and adds the stalks whole. Some of them need to be folded in half to fit, and he does so carefully so as not to break off any of the flowers.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">Insomnia runs in my family, afflicting both sides of it with equal intensity. That’s nearly four centuries of Mexican tossing and Italian turning, with fits of German cursing and crying in between. A long heritage of discomfort, and, according to family gossip, one that has only been interrupted by the rotting medicines that tempt anyone who’s had to put up with an extended period of lost sleep – drugs, alcohol, compulsive anger, and every possible combination of the three. With the advent of psychotherapy, and the discovery that trauma is an actual illness and not a defect of character, many of us have learned to deal with insomnia in less destructive ways.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">Flour is highly flammable, but maybe you know that. 

                    I remember once, when I was a teenager, someone at tailgate party tossed a cup of flour into the air over the fire we'd built. It went "WHOOSH" and lit the sky for miles up, or so it seemed. 
                    
                    Thank God there was no wind. It was epic. I had had a few tokes and I was trying to articulate to my friend Clarisse how my mother worked with flour every day, making it into things, and yet, watching it become NOTHING was so much more spectacular. 
                    
                    Clarisse was busy watching a moth on her sleeve, so I'm not sure she was even listening. 
                    
                    It's funny how you remember things. Even stoned, I remember that so clearly, how impressive that quick flour fire was, and how it overshadowed my mother's pedestrian use of flour and fire.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">The first time you have a miscarriage, your loved ones might send you flowers. You might get a beautiful tree to plant from a loved one who has found peace in her own grief. Someone will send a box of chocolates - the finest ones they could find - with a note that says, “Sending love. Hope this helps.” It doesn’t, but you appreciate the gesture. You’ll take a week off work to grieve. You’ll watch movies without really seeing them, you’ll cry until your face is raw, and you’ll eat every chocolate in that box. Even the ones you hate. Nothing tastes the same anyway. A few times you’ll laugh but you’ll feel guilty about that, which will make you cry again. One night the insomnia will be impossible to overcome, and you’ll give up trying to sleep, opting instead to scrub your kitchen from top to bottom at three in the morning. You’ll need a surgery.</p>

                    I was away at college in Pennsylvania, attending my residency, a ten day reprieve from the Florida heat, my husband, and my kids.
                    
                    The first time I saw her, she was chatting on her cell phone in the restroom. I caught her reflection in the mirror and smiled. She didn’t seem to notice or was too wrapped up in her conversation to wave back.
                    
                    No matter, I thought. I was busy, myself.
                    
                    The next time I saw her, she was in class, reading aloud a rough draft of our latest assignment. The piece she shared was raw and edgy, and she made no apologies for raising her voice nor did she seem to feel remorseful for speaking her mind.</p>

                    It is my contentment that makes
                    Me smile without reason on the streets;
                    It is my heart,
                    The source of this raving frenzy.
                    I am not silent, I can’t keep quiet
                    Like the dead beneath the dirt
                    In the midst of this sweet world.</p>

If someone had asked you what you loved most, you would not have said that it was this thing. But now that the thief has stolen it, you understand from its absence it is the thing you love most. You wander around town, looking in dumpsters, checking pawnshops, asking strangers, hoping to find the thing you love. You get some good intel from a few cool snails & head to the bluffs overlooking the cacophonous river. The thief is there, standing at the edge of the bluffs, their back to you.</p>
